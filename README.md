# 📊 Faculty Self-Appraise System

The **Faculty Self-Appraise System** is a modern, web-based platform designed to simplify the self-appraisal process for faculty members.

Administrators can efficiently view, manage, and evaluate the submissions, and even generate PDF reports. The system is user-friendly, secure, and supports paperless operations, aligning with the *Digital India* and *Paperless* initiatives.
